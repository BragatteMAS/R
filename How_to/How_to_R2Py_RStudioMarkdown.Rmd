# Using Python with R in Rstudio

First at Console:

usethis::edit_r\_profile()

When a new Rprofile file open put this code with path for OS or env python:

Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "../bin/python")

after this restart R.\
\
Inside the markdown file it is possible to edit the same DataFrame and operate with both languages.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
olar = 'Python in R is real!'
print(olar)

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
